# Airtable-Scripts
A collection of AirTable Script for the whoever needs them

# Multi-Record-Updater:
This script updated multiple records at a time. I created it because I was frusterated that Airtable on had a "Update Record" action which only take one record ID as input. It takes the output of the "Find Records" action as input.
