# Airtable-Scripts
A collection of AirTable Script for the whoever needs them

# Multi-Record-Updater:

This script updated multiple records at a time. I created it because I was frusterated that Airtable on had a "Update Record" action which only take one record ID as input. It takes the output of the "Find Records" action as input. 

# IDer:

This script with generate a unqiue ID for each new record and check to make sure that it does already exist. The format of the id is the first 2 letters of the records name and 4 random digits 1000-9999.
  
# Geocoder:

This script will Geocode an address into a Lat Lng.
